		PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
		Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and
		analyzing text data. PDFMiner allows to obtain the exact location of
		texts in a page, as well as other information such as fonts or lines.
		It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files into other
		text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible PDF parser that can
		be used for other purposes instead of text analysis.
