# I was adding this (IUSE=static-libs) due to work-related demands. With the
# benefit of hindsight, I acknowledge that this approach was suboptimal.
# Presently, in situations where static linking is indispensable, my
# preference leans decidedly towards bundling dependencies at the project
# level rather than installing static libraries system-wide.
# Use libscrypt in gentoo repo instead.
# Removal in 30 days.
